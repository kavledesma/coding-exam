# Problem Set 1: Palindrome Pairs

## Problem Description
You need to check every combination of words in an array if they are palindromes.

## Solution Overview
The main problem, for me, in this problem set is how to properly check every combination of values (words) in a given array.

I solved it by running the array on a nested for-loop to compare and concantenate each words with one another.
