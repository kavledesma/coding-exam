# Coding Challenge 

## Overview
This is a coding exam to test my programming capabilities. 

The coding challenge consists of 3 problem sets that ranges its difficulty from easy to moderate.

## Instruction to Run the Code
After cloning this repository, install the dependencies by running the command:
```
npm install
```

To run the server, run this command:
```
npm run coding-exam
```

I've written my solutions in NodeJS, so in order to test my solutions, you'll need an API testing platfrom (i.e. Postman).

You can get the needed details of each problem set in its own README.md file.
